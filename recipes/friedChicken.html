    <p>
        Here is a recipe on how to make jolibee style fried chicken <br> jolibee
        is like the better version of kfc because they have a wider variety of
        cousines and specials. I think in the philipines they have adobo rice
        which I look forward to trying in the future. <br> Fried chicken is the 
        perfect food because it can be eaten as a hearty meal or just a small 
        snack. It is very convenient and delicious most of all.
